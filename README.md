# ❌⭕ Tic-Tac-Toe AI (Minimax Edition)

A terminal-based **Tic-Tac-Toe game** written in Python where you play against an **unbeatable AI** powered by the **Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning**.

The AI does not make mistakes.  
Your job is to try anyway.

## 🎮 How the Game Works

- You play as **X**
- The AI plays as **O**
- The board is a 3×3 grid
- You enter moves using **row and column numbers (0–2)**
- The AI calculates the best possible move every turn

If you win, congratulations — that’s rare.  
If you lose… the AI will let you know.

## 🧠 AI Logic (Minimax + Alpha-Beta Pruning)

This project uses:
- **Minimax algorithm** to evaluate all possible game states
- **Alpha-Beta pruning** to optimize performance
- Depth-based scoring to prefer faster wins and slower losses

Result:  
➡️ The AI is **mathematically optimal** and **cannot be beaten**
